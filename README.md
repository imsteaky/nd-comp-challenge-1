# No Man's Sky Fansite Recreation in CSS-Grid

The NEXT update for No Man’s Sky will finally arrive on Xbox and on the previous systems (PS4 and PC) on July 24th. 
It will have true multiplayer in the game for the first time. I took this opportunity to test out my new-found powers in CSS grid, and may have found <em>myself</em> along the way.

<em> You’ll be able to explore the universe with a small group of friends, or bump into random travelers. 
You can help friends to stay alive, or prey on others to survive. Tiny shelters or complex colonies that you 
build as a team are shared for all players. Fight as a pirate or a wingman in epic space battles with friends and enemies. 
Race exocraft across weird alien terrains, creating race tracks and trails to share online.</em> - Hello Games
